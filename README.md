## Usage

Define policies inside the `policies` folder in your Chart. e.g. Pods must run as nonRoot:
```
deny[msg] {
  input.kind = "Deployment"
  not input.spec.template.spec.securityContext.runAsNonRoot = true
  msg = "Containers must not run as root"
}
```

Run the policy check:
```sh
# helm opa CHART
Processing file deployment.yaml
Violations:
- Containers must not run as root
Processing file ingress.yaml
Processing file service.yaml
===
Result: Chart is not compliant
```

## Install

```sh
$ helm plugin install https://github.com/shift/helm-opa
```
